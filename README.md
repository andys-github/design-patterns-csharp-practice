# Design Patterns

## Gamma Categorization
- Design Patterns are typically split into three categories
- This is called *Gamma Categorization* after Eric Gamma, one of the GoF authors
  -  ### Creational Patterns
     - Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
     - Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc)
     - Wholesale (single statement) vs. piece-wise (Step-by-step)

  -  ### Structural Patterns
     -  Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members)
     -  Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface
     -  Stress the importance of good API design
  -  ### Behavioral Patterns
     -  They are all different; no central theme
     -  Each one tries to solve a particular problem
